# Chtholly Language Development Roadmap

## Milestone 1: Core Language and Syntax

- [x] **Comments:** Implement single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments.
- [x] **Main Function:** Implement the `main` function as the entry point of the program.
- [x] **Variables:**
    - [x] `let` declarations
    - [x] `mut` declarations
- [x] **Data Types:** Implement basic data types: `int`, `double`, `char`, `string`, `bool`.
- [x] **Operators:**
    - [x] Basic arithmetic
    - [x] Comparison
    - [x] Logical
- [x] **Control Flow:**
    - [x] `if-else` statements
    - [x] `while` loops
    - [ ] `for` loops
    - [ ] `foreach` loops
    - [x] `do-while` loops

## Milestone 2: Functions and Scope

- [x] **Functions:**
    - [x] Function definitions
    - [x] Function calls
- [ ] **Ownership and Borrowing:** Implement the ownership and borrowing system for memory management.
- [ ] **Scope:** Implement lexical scoping for variables and functions.

## Milestone 3: Compound Data Types

- [ ] **Arrays:** Implement static and dynamic arrays.
- [ ] **Structs:** Implement `struct` definitions and instantiations.
- [ ] **Enums:** Implement `enum` definitions and pattern matching.

## Milestone 4: Classes and Object-Oriented Features

- [ ] **Classes:** Implement `class` definitions, including member variables, constructors, and destructors.
- [ ] **Member Functions:** Implement member functions with `self`, `&self`, and `&mut self`.
- [ ] **Access Modifiers:** Implement `public` and `private` access modifiers.

## Milestone 5: Advanced Features

- [ ] **Generics:** Implement generic functions and classes.
- [ ] **Modules:** Implement a module system with `import` and `use` statements.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Implement `Result<T, E>` for error handling.
- [ ] **Lambdas:** Implement lambda expressions.

## Milestone 6: Standard Library
