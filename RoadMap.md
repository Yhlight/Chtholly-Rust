# Chtholly Language Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the Chtholly programming language.

## Phase 1: Core Language Features

- [ ] Basic syntax parsing (variables, data types, operators)
- [x] Variable declaration parsing
- [x] Function definitions and calls
- [ ] Control flow (if/else, loops)
- [ ] Basic type checking
- [ ] LLVM IR generation for simple expressions and functions

## Phase 2: Advanced Language Features

- [ ] Ownership and borrowing system
- [ ] Structs and classes
- [ ] Modules and imports
- [ ] Generics
- [ ] Error handling with `Result<T, E>`

## Phase 3: Standard Library

- [ ] I/O operations (console, file)
- [ ] String manipulation
- [ ] Collections (arrays, vectors)
- [ ] Optional type

## Phase 4: Tooling and Ecosystem

- [ ] Build system and package manager
- [ ] Language server for IDE integration
- [ ] Debugger support
